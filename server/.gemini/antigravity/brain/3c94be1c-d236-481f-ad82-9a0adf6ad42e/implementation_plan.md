# Codebase Humanization Plan (Phase 2)

Following the successful execution of Phase 1 (MVC refactoring for Auth, formatting, and debug file cleanup), I performed a deeper scan of the entire project to ensure **every file and folder** meets professional evaluation standards. 

## User Review Required

> [!CAUTION]
> I found that the project is completely missing a root `README.md` file. In software engineering evaluations, the README is the very first thing an evaluator sees. A missing README strongly implies a rushed or generated project. Please review my proposal below to fix this.

## Proposed Changes

---

### 1. Professional Root README.md
I will create a comprehensive, beautifully formatted `README.md` in the root directory that includes:
- **Project Structure**: A clean tree outlining the `client/` and `server/` separation.
- **Tech Stack**: Detailing MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js (MERN), Tailwind, etc.
- **Design Patterns**: Specifically calling out the use of the **MVC architecture** in the backend (which we just built) to impress the evaluators.
- **Getting Started**: Clear instructions on how to install, set environment variables, and run both the frontend and backend.

### 2. Final Architecture Sweep
- I will verify that the remaining backend files in `/services` and `/routes` are cleanly formatted.
- I will ensure there are no glaring console logs or placeholder `TODO` comments left in the client UI that an evaluator might accidentally click on.

## Verification Plan
- Visually inspect the generated `README.md` to ensure it looks like a senior developer's repository documentation.
- Do a final static check of the file tree to guarantee naming conventions are consistent (e.g., camelCase for controllers, kabab-case for routes).
